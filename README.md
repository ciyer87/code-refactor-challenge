# code-refactor-challenge

This challenge is about refactoring an existing webpage and make it accessible.  Additionally, all links should be functioning correctly and CSS needs to be cleaned up to make it more efficient, consolidate CSS selectors and properties, organize them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and add comments before each element or section of the page.

* The following image (**mockup**) shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![A website with a navigation, a hero image, sections on the left and center and a footer](assets/images/challenge1-screenshot.png)

*  The **URL of the deployed application**: (https://ciyer87.github.io/code-refactor-challenge)
