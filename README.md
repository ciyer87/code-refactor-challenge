# code-refactor-challenge

This challenge is about refactoring an existing webpage and make it accessible.  Additionally, ensured that all links are functioning correctly and cleaned up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidated CSS selectors and properties, organized them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each element or section of the page.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
